# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v1.5.2

### App DB: ownership and APN tags

`app-db-prereqs` and `app-db` always stamp `superblocks:owned=true` and
`aws-apn-id=pc:ctelqp437y3cvjkv5rv0z2w4f` on resources they create; lifecycle-worker
IAM protects those keys from removal.
([#66](https://github.com/superblocksteam/terraform-aws-superblocks/pull/66))

### App DB prereqs: independent IAM / S3 name prefixes

`name_prefix` is replaced by `iam_name_prefix` and `s3_name_prefix` (both default
`sb-app-db`). Callers that set `name_prefix` must switch to the two new variables.
([#67](https://github.com/superblocksteam/terraform-aws-superblocks/pull/67))

### App DB prereqs: create-time tags on security-group rules

Create-time `ec2:CreateTags` authorization now covers security-group rule creates
(`AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` / `Egress`) in addition to `CreateSecurityGroup`.
([#68](https://github.com/superblocksteam/terraform-aws-superblocks/pull/68))
